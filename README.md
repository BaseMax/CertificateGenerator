## Getting Started

To use this script, follow these simple steps:

- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your terminal.
- Edit the `names.txt` file and add the names of the people you want to generate certificates for, each on a new line.
- Customize and update the `certificate-background.png` file according to your certificate design and style to reflect your organization's branding.
- Run the `generator.py` script by typing `python generator.py`.
- Your certificates will be generated and saved in the `output` directory as the `generator.py` file, with the participant's name added to the filename.

## Customization

This script uses `certificate-background.png` as the raw certificate background style. You can customize the style and color according to your preference to match your event's design.

You can also modify the certificate background file to change the message and other details that appear on the certificate.

Please feel free to customize and adapt this script to suit your needs.
